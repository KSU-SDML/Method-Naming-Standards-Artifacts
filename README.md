# Overview

This repository contains a spreadsheet of a golden set that has been created for evaluating a method naming standards approach.
The golden set is created using Notepad++ with a total of 354 method names.

# Golden Set Evaluation

Each of the approch paper authors was assigned a spreadsheet that contains the 354 method names, with columns representing the ten method naming standards: 
1. Naming style
2. Grammatical structure
3. Verb phrase
4. Dictionary terms
5. Full words
6. Idioms and slang
7. Abbreviations
8. Acronyms
9. Prefix/suffix
10. Length

In addition, a column contains the source-code file path of the method name-- for the evaluatorâ€™s reference. Each evaluator is asked to check each name for adherence to the standard, and for each method name, the evaluator marks any violated standards. For example, if a method name does not contain a verb, the evaluator marks the verb phrase standard as a violation for that name (TRUE) if it does contain a verb, then it means (FALSE) in the provided sheet.
