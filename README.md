**Overview**

This repository contains a spreadsheet of a golden set that has been created for evaluating a method naming standards approach.
The golden set created using Notepad++ with a total of 354 method names.

**Golden Set Evaluation**

Each of the approch paper authors was assigned a spreadsheet that contains the 354 method names, with columns representing the ten method naming standards: naming style, grammatical structure, verb phrase, dictionary terms, full words, idioms and slang, abbreviations, acronyms, prefix/suffix, and length.  In addition, a column contains the source-code file path of the method name-- for the evaluatorâ€™s reference. Each evaluator is asked to check each name for adherence to the standard, and for each method name, the evaluator marks any violated standards. For example, if a method name does not contain a verb, the evaluator marks the verb phrase standard as a violation for that name (TRUE) if it does contain a verb, then it means (FALSE) in the provided sheet.
